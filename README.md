# 국회는 지금 (National Assembly Now)

[국회는 지금 (Nanow)](http://labs.popong.com/codenamu) visualizes the seating of the 18th National Assembly of Korea.

> Was built in a two-day hackathon, so the code is pretty messy.

## Created
- [Codenamu](http://codenamu.org/)'s [2012 Open Data Camp](http://codenamu.org/projec/open-data-camp) Hackathon
- July 20th, 2012

## In order to make your own

1. Modify seat paths, and overwrite `seats.js`. (Easy to do if you have an existing SVG)
1. Input person information in json format to `people.json`.
1. Encode color labels at `nofwins.html`.
